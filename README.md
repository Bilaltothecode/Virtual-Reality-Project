# CS 458/858 Winter 2022: Team Immersion

Our study is focused on benchmarking several different sensori-motor contingencies, as described by [Mel Slater](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2009.0138).

We've compiled an MVP of some of the scenes we developed/tested in our study, which you can download and run on an Oculus Quest HMD.

### What you'll need

- Oculus Developer account
- Oculus HMD ([dev mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1gwgSpU3E)) + controllers
